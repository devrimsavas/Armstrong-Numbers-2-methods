
An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3**3 + 7**3 + 1**3 = 371.

For beginners: Here's a little experiment. The next two programs identify Armstrong numbers within a specified range. In the second example, I've incorporated multiprocessing to observe the outcomes (actually i never used such things before. That was just and idea. Impressively, it computed numbers from 0 to 84,000,000 in an incredibly short duration.

Start by running the first program, but ensure you set a manageable range. Afterward, proceed to the second program. There's always room for improvement in coding routines. Should you have any inquiries regarding the routines, feel free to ask.
